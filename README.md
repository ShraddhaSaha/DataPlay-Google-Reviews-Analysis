 I have completed this project on "DATAPLAY's Google Reviews Analysis" during my Data Science and Analytics internship at DataPlay.
 I analyzed the real-time Google reviews from the candidates on enrolling in the Data science and Analytics internship at DataPlay, to find meaningful insights from their text responses.

ðŸ“Š Methods Used: MS Excel is used in the data preparation part with some advanced formulas like 
UNIQUE and COUNTIF function ( for Count vectorizer)
Text-to-columns tab with delimiter and Transpose (for Tokenization)
Power BI is used in the data analysis part where we imported and used WORD CLOUD only.
